The event is structured in three stages: Stage 1 – Ideation (online submission of concept report), Stage 2 – Proof of Concept (structured report + video demonstration), and Stage 3 – On-Site Finals at VIT Chennai. In the Finals, teams compete in two trials: (i) Mobility Trial – obstacle avoidance and checkpoint navigation across terrains with sand, mud, stones, uneven paths, humps, and sharp turns, and (ii) Manipulation Trial – precise pick-and-place of colored blocks at different heights under terrain difficulties. Judging will be based on time, accuracy, efficiency, robustness, innovation, and safety, with bonus recognition for autonomous mobility. As part of TechnoVIT, Pravahan 1.0 offers a national platform for showcasing innovation, applied engineering, and teamwork, supported by prizes, patent assistance, and industry exposure.",

The event begins with a two-hour session led by a spokesperson, where industry insights and professional works will be shared to inspire and guide participants before they begin their projects.<br> <br> Following this, teams will immerse themselves in an intensive creation phase, working to conceptualize and produce original animated projects within the given timeframe. From crafting characters and worlds to experimenting with techniques and storytelling, participants will push their creative boundaries. The event concludes with a showcase judged on creativity, narrative impact, and technical execution, making Animatathon both a competition and a collaborative platform to learn, innovate, and connect within the animation community.",

        "longDescription": "This event revolves around the concept of process planning, which is the first step to any workflow in an industry. Participants will be split into teams where they will play the role of process engineers tasked with designing their own mini production plant within a stipulated time. They will receive a set of process blocks (mixers, conveyors, heaters, packaging units, etc.), each with different speeds, costs, and reliability ratings, and must arrange them to create the most efficient and cost-effective production line possible. Once teams finalize their plant layouts, their production output will be simulated live and a leaderboard will be displayed. Participants will also be challenged with random breakdowns or market changes, forcing them to skillfully reconfigure their design under time pressure. Judging will be based on efficiency of plant layout, cost optimization, output performance, adaptability under challenges, creativity in design, and teamwork/presentation. This game aims to simulate a practical and realistic work environment for the same and equip the students with knowledge on how things really work in an industry, while also keeping entertaining and lighthearted. This gamified version of process planning aligns with AutoVIT’s scope of industrial automation where process planning is a key step, and also teaches students in a way where they have fun and enjoy learning.",
